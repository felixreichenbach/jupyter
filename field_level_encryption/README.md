# Client Side Field Level Encryption Demo

This demo is built upon a Jupyter Notebook and uses a local mongodb node and python to demonstrate client side field level encryption end to end.

The code is written in Python and can easily be adjusted to accomodate specific needs.

Please provide feedback and suggestions for improvement!

If you haven't worked with Jupyter yet, please head to https://jupyter.org/.

Installation on your Mac is easy and straight forward!
